Injera Card Game is simple two player card game where the goal is to accumulate as many cards as possible by selecting faced down cards and matching them to faced up cards in the middle pile. The cards are arranged in a circular fashion similar to the Ethiopian/Eritrean food Injera â€“ hence the name.

# **How to Play**

1. Player 1 selects any faced down card and places it faced up in the middle of the pile.
2. Player 2 selects any faced down card.
3. If there is no matching digit or letter (when comparing the picked card and the card in the middle of the pile) the player places the card faced up in middle. 
4. If there is a matching digit or letter (when comparing the picked card and the card in the middle of the pile), the player takes the card from the middle of the pile.
5. Player 1 and Player 2 pick faced down cards in alternating turns and check if step 2 or 3 apply.  Continue playing until there are no cards left to pick.
6. Winner is determined by Player with the greatest number of cards.
